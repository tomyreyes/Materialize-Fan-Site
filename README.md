# Fan Website 

In this project I created a fan website for the band Of Monsters and Men. 

This website was built using:

*[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

*[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)

The purpose of this project was to build on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, familiarize ourselves with jQuery as well as to become more familiar with responsive design.

### Materialize:

Materialize is a framework created by Google in 2014. It was created based on the visual language material design. Some core
principles behind material design are:

+ **Material is the metaphor** - design emulates what we see in reality to inspire familiarty, creativity and innovation 

+ **Bold, graphic and intentional** - fundamental design techniques are the driving force that create immersive user interfaces

+ **Motion provides meaning** - the use of animation in meaningful ways such as focusing and direction attention
